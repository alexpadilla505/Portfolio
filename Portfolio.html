    <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
    <p>Rising senior at De Anza High School, my passion for computer science
      stems from my love for computers as a child. In my freetime I enjoy
    photography, music, and art. My academic and professional interests
    include repairing computer hardware, video production, and troubleshooting
    software issues</p>
      <p>Today, we learned about data structures. A list is organized or unorganized 
      number of connected items written consecutively. This can be helpful for numerous
      items.</p>
